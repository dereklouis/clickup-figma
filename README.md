This is a mini project for ClickUp.

I have turned [this figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/qNLG2DvzowucTvhyYoM6KB/HTML-and-CSS-Engineer-Mini-Project) into a fully responsive web page dowwn to 320px (iPhone 5), using only vanilla HTML / CSS.

To view the page, clone the repo, and:

Option 1: Open the file with live server

or

Option 2: Open the index.html file in your browser
